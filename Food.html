                    Any material that an organism consumes for nutritional support is considered food. Food is typically derived from plants, animals, or fungi and includes vital nutrients such proteins, lipids, carbs, and vitamins and minerals. An organism consumes the material, which is then absorbed by the organism's cells to supply energy, sustain life, or promote growth. Different animal species have developed distinct eating habits to meet the demands of their metabolisms and to occupy particular ecological niches in particular geographic settings.

                    Several other social and political issues, such as sustainability, biological diversity, economics, population expansion, water availability, and food security, are significantly impacted by the food system. International organisations including the World Resources Institute, the Food and Agriculture Organisation, the International Food Information Council, the International Association for Food Protection, and the World Food Programme keep an eye on food safety and security.

                    Food can be categorised in a number of ways, based on processing methods or related content. Food groupings can differ in terms of both number and makeup. Four fundamental groupings are present in most systems, which explain their respective nutritional purpose and origin: Fruit and Vegetables; Bread and Cereals; Dairy and Meat.Research on diet quality categorise foods into whole grains and cereals, refined grains and cereals, fruits, vegetables, dairy products, nuts, legumes, fish, red meat, processed meat, eggs, dairy products, and beverages with added sugar. Nineteen food categories are used by the Food and Agriculture Organisation and the World Health Organisation: cereals, legumes, nuts, milk, eggs, fish and shellfish, meat, insects, vegetables, fruits, fats and oils, sweets and sugars, and vegetable-based foods for nutritional purposes.

                    The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that tainted food causes 600 million illnesses and 420,000 deaths globally annually.With over 550 million instances and 230,000 fatalities annually, diarrhea is the most prevalent sickness brought on by eating tainted food. With 125,000 deaths annually from foodborne illness, children under five make up 40% of the disease's victims.

                    Approximately thirty percent of food poisoning outbreaks recorded in the WHO European Region take place in private households, according to a 2003 World Health Organization (WHO) report.In the United States alone, there are 76 million episodes of foodborne disease each year, which result in 325,000 hospital admissions and 5,000 fatalities, according to the WHO and CDC.

                    Food contains nutrientsâ€”substances essential for the growth, repair, and maintenance of body tissues and for the regulation of vital processes. Nutrients provide the energy our bodies need to function. The energy in food is measured in units called calories.
