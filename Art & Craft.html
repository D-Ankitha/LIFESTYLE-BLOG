                  The term "arts and crafts" refers to a broad range of handicraft-related activities. Crafts and the arts are typically hobbies. While certain crafts and artistic abilities date back to prehistoric times, some are relatively modern creations. The term "arts and crafts" gained popularity in the late 19th century thanks to the promotion of a movement by William Morris, John Ruskin, and other individuals.

                    Arts and crafts are enjoyable for both kids and adults. In schools, kids can learn how to sew, carve wood, work with fabric, and create items out of many materials. There are lots of community centres and schools that offer daytime or evening programmes and workshops where people can learn how to make crafts.The attempt to modify design and ornamentation in Britain in the middle of the 19th century gave rise to the Arts and Crafts movement. The reformers linked factory productivity and machinery to a purported deterioration in standards, which prompted their response.

                    The objects in the Great Exhibition of 1851, which they viewed as unduly elaborate, manufactured, and oblivious to the properties of the materials utilised, further honed their criticism. The exhibitions, according to art historian Nikolaus Pevsner, displayed "vulgarity in detail" as well as "ignorance of that basic need in creating patterns, the integrity of the surface".

                    Thomas Carlyle's writings had a significant influence on John Ruskin's social criticism, which served as a major source for the Arts and Crafts movement.
                    Ruskin connected the character of a country's labour and its architectural features to its moral and social well-being. Ruskin believed that independent workers who designed the things they manufactured were necessary for a virtuous and moral society, and that the mechanised production and division of labour brought out by the industrial revolution constituted "servile labour.
